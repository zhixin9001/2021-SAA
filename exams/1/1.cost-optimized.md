### Question 1: Incorrect
The engineering team at an e-commerce company is working on cost optimizations for EC2 instances. The team wants to manage the workload using a mix of on-demand and spot instances across multiple instance types. They would like to create an Auto Scaling group with a mix of these instances.

Which of the following options would allow the engineering team to provision the instances for this use-case?

#### Tips
- both launch template and launch config are used for ASG to launch EC2 instances, but launch config are old and not recommend, the both support:
ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), 
the instance type, 
a key pair, 
security groups, 
and the other parameters that you use to launch EC2 instances. 

- but, launch config doesn's support:
multiple versions,
support multiple instance types using both On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances

### Question 4: Incorrect
A news network uses Amazon S3 to aggregate the raw video footage from its reporting teams across the US. The news network has recently expanded into new geographies in Europe and Asia. The technical teams at the overseas branch offices have reported huge delays in uploading large video files to the destination S3 bucket.

Which of the following are the MOST cost-effective options to improve the file upload speed into S3? (Select two)

#### Tips
- Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration **takes advantage of Amazon CloudFrontâ€™s globally distributed edge locations**. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

- Use multipart uploads for faster file uploads into the destination S3 bucket,independently, retry any part,  100 MB

- Create multiple AWS direct connect connections between the AWS Cloud and branch offices in Europe and Asia. Use the direct connect connections for faster file uploads into S3 - **AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS**. AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. **Direct connect takes significant time (several months) to be provisioned and is an overkill for the given use-case.**

- Create multiple site-to-site VPN connections between the AWS Cloud and branch offices in Europe and Asia. Use these VPN connections for faster file uploads into S3 - AWS Site-to-Site VPN enables you to **securely** connect your on-premises network or branch office site to your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). You can securely extend your data center or branch office network to the cloud with an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. A VPC VPN Connection utilizes IPSec to establish encrypted network connectivity between your intranet and Amazon VPC over the Internet. VPN Connections are a good solution if you have **low to modest** bandwidth requirements and can tolerate the inherent variability in Internet-based connectivity. **Site-to-site VPN will not help in accelerating the file transfer speeds into S3** for the given use-case.

- Use AWS Global Accelerator for faster file uploads into the destination S3 bucket - AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. It provides **static IP addresses** that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, such as your **Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers or Amazon EC2 instances.** AWS Global Accelerator will **not help in accelerating the file transfer speeds** into S3 for the given use-case.

### Question 20: Correct
A media company wants to get out of the business of owning and maintaining its own IT infrastructure. As part of this digital transformation, the media company wants to archive about 5PB of data in its on-premises data center to durable long term storage.

As a solutions architect, what is your recommendation to migrate this data in the MOST cost-optimal way?

#### Tips
- Transfer the on-premises data into multiple Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices. Copy the Snowball Edge data into Amazon S3 and create a lifecycle policy to transition the data into AWS Glacier
It provides up to 80 TB of usable HDD storage, 40 vCPUs, 1 TB of SATA SSD storage, and up to 40 Gb network connectivity to address large scale data transfer and pre-processing use cases. 
You can't directly copy data from Snowball Edge devices into AWS Glacier.

### Question 28: Incorrect
A company wants to migrate its on-premises databases to AWS Cloud. The CTO at the company wants a solution that can handle complex database configurations such as secondary indexes, foreign keys, and stored procedures.

As a solutions architect, which of the following AWS services should be combined to handle this use-case? (Select two)

#### Tips
- AWS Schema Conversion Tool + AWS Database Migration Service
